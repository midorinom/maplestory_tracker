# Maplestory Tracker

## Introduction
As a maplestory player, I used to make numerous spreadsheets to keep track of various information such as dailies, bosses and progression for each of my characters.
It was an extremely tedious process to set up the spreadsheets with the the fields that I wanted and annoying to navigate between spreadsheets for different characters
as I had to duplicate every spreadsheet for the number of characters that I had. Not to mention, excel sheets are just ugly and unpleasant to look at, with only visual
representations of raw data of words and numbers.

This was my inspiration for making this tracker app to provide a convenient platform for players to keep track of their information in an interface that is simple to use
and visually appealing. I catered this app for players in both the MapleSEA (Southeast Asia) and GMS (Global) servers, as I have played extensively in both regions
and also have friends in both regions, who would potentially be using this app.
